# Sql-challenge
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). The first task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.  The task is to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
This following three parts include: 
Data modeling:
-Sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like Quick DBD 
Data engineering:
-Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
Data analysis:
-List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
-List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
-List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
